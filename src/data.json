    "content": "There was a conversation with a question, does a parent give a DNA test report to their child to prove that they are his parent. No question about that. We accept them as parents from birth. So the conclusion people want to prove is that you can’t ask for logic for everything. You should blindly trust and accept something you don’t understand or the other party doesn’t want to discuss. That topic really bothered me for a long time. Truly how can I know that they are my parents. But, now I do understand. That’s a relief from my Almighty Allah. I know how much peace it gives. You don’t have to know whether they are your real parents. As much as they care for you. Take care of yourself, they deserve to get treated as the parents do. Like given birth mother, and genetic father they are in the highest position. But, so many people also support us every step of life. They also become comparable to our mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, grandfathers, grandmothers, grandchildren, and uncle-aunty… Actually, we all are connected. And from the acts, people prove who they are to us. We also prove ourselves who we are through our actions. Just keep sharp your brain, mind, sight, hearing….. you will understand which is what. And the last wisdom, lies never stay hidden, Have faith in Allah."

    "content": "Sometimes life brings more than we can bear. Knowing about Magura's Incident disturbed me too much. So many memories came to me as the storm. Trauma, It's too painful to tolerate.\n\nReally devils do exist and they do deserve the hell without any doubt.\n\nSome people say Look how bad people are. I am not doing that much bad so I am good. Even they are Zalim. Some say that happened to a child, it can be tolerable if it would happen to a grown-up. I do rape to grown-up so don't point at me. Other says doing bad to an unknown person is better than doing bad to the known person.\n\nDevils do live everywhere in so many disguises. Some people are proud that they are not too bad, they are tolerable bad, worse is happening in the world. So don’t account them that they are bad. They can do much more bad but they are not doing. Take it as a mercy. \n\nBad incidents always happen in their life, so live a whole life with lies and be happy, don’t complain about anything. Much more bad is happening in the outside world. Husband is killing wife, so beating wife is a minor issue for them. Mentally, Emotionally, and physically torture is minor. See you are living so that you can do something about it, take it as mercy from them. \n\nGo to the world and see that people are not getting food to eat, have no shelter. I am giving you food and shelter, and you are complaining about what toxic behavior, toxicity. Tolerate when you don’t earn. Forget all bad things, but I will not forgive you even the slightest good. You need to be better than angle. I am your GOD because husbands are worthy to get prostrated, If Hz. Muhammad sm said if he would say to give sajda to anyone other than Allah it would be the husband.   \n\nYou need to be better because you are Islamic. But I don’t care what Islam is, what does it say? Know Islam to give me the advantage, I learnt some of the broken Quranic ayah and hadith to take all the advantage to astray you from your religion, morality, humanity. What Islam did you learn?! What does Islam do to you?! What does Islam teach you, to talk back?! You talk too much, what does Islam teach you ?! But I don’t care about Islam. \n\nPeople think Islam should be weak. Islamic people mean weak, have no other way to live, their life is finished, without livelihood, begging, forgiving everything, crying in secret, keep everything in secret even if they see crime. They do forgive the worst because they are too merciful. As Hz. Muhammad sm was so merciful, forgave his enemy, kafir. \n\nPeople say killing is a sin. What is killing, which kind of killing?!  Abortion is legal in this world. People are killing children secretly. \n\nSEX what? Is it shameful something?! Nasty things?! How prophets do sex and worship Allah simultaneously. SEX is a purified thing. Some people will never understand. People's mentality got rotten. \n\nNo, I am not fantasizing about all those. I faced those in my life. I encounter that type of people in my life. I am so happy that Allah created hell. \n\nSome people have too much honor, so they reduce their problems in the name of honor killing. People don’t have any fear. Why should all people need to get rahmat?! Don’t dua for everyone to have some brain, mind, and humanity.\n\nAllah did create Heaven for Human beings. Allah didn’t give heaven to the angels. And angles do everything that Allah orders. Some people do have problems with Allah and angles too. With Prophets, the Quran, and hadith too. Why doesn’t Allah save the good people?! Why doesn’t Allah listen to Islamic people?! Why does Allah give Islamic people hardship ?! Don’t explain, don’t argue with people, they just don’t deserve your effort.\n\nHUMANS HAVE SOME BRAIN. WHERE IS YOUR MIND. "

I am writing this only for those kind of people.\n\nSome people in this world think they need to be good and be generous to everyone. But you can’t do that, can you?\n\nI mean if people love a noble person and the worst criminal both. It will be chaos.\n\nYou can’t love good and support bad at the same time. It is a person’s own choice, how they want to represent themselves. That is totally an individual choice, an individual world, his own kingdom.\n\nImagine a king telling another king to be responsible and lead his own kingdom the right way. Yes, this sentence can mean many things like friendly advice for a king to another king, or warning, or declaring war.\n\nOf course, we have so many examples of this in the real world. Children have to listen to their parents. In reality, it doesn’t happen or sometimes it is impossible. Some children listen and obey their parents and give proper respect and in this case, parents are good, friendly, and wise. It is so nice example. Who doesn’t want this in their life, right? But in our lives, we all have our own tasks and, our own challenges differently. No one gets perfect from all sides.\n\nIn this world, we all struggle. We all have our own lives and our own advantages, ease side also our own burden, challenges.\n\nYou can’t tell another person that he has an easy life. You can’t. Because it is impossible. If you do that then the thing is, you become the one who wants to flee from your own tasks and challenges and regret seeing some specific benefits that others get, you just want those benefits not exchanging your whole life with anyone.\n\nYes, as we get tasks and challenges. we have also given necessary equipment some useful, some burdens…..\n\nYou know what, you have to solve your problem yourself. There is no one there who will get your job done. If they would do that, that would be their job done, not yours deed."

It makes you the best version of you.\n\nBut sometimes the Amateur lover can’t control or balance that much bigger journey/life project so they fail and then return with the wrong conclusion.\n\nAfter all, even the most intelligent, wiser, brave, strong, confident, decisive, best character personality person finds it hard. And they are the ones who gain the title “Lover”. Surprising.\n\nLove is so wide, so precious that I can’t explain it through some words nor without a lover anyone will understand it.\n\nBut for the Lover, even silent existence will explain everything."

If I say this in the psychological language they are narcissists. If I say in the armed forces language they are traitors. In religious language hypocrite. And if I say in my language it is a total liar, weaker, coward, irritated, total head pain person.\n\nI don’t know formal language. What I know is straightforward language. I don’t understand people.

    "content": "You see we are human. Of course, there are so many living creatures and many things out there. But for now, I want to talk about just about us. About our identity.\n\nThere is a quote, “Who learned himself, he learned all too”. I don’t know if is there really any quote like that. But I believe in that. From my inside, it comes to me.\n\nIn this world, there are so many countries, so many languages, so many traditions, so many identities people….. There are so many differences from person to person. But on some points, we are all the same. What ???\n\nWe are human, we are dependent, we are civilized.\n\nAs humans, we see there are three parts of our neediness, physical, mental, and soul. They are all connected to each other. All should be put into balance. Leadership is in our hands. But there are some limitations. Am I making it so much complex !? Ok, I wanna make it easy to understand.\n\nAs you see humans have limitations. In everything they have limits. For eating, for sleeping, for drinking……. till leaving this world. No one knows which type of baby is coming and when. Or when, and how that baby will die.\n\nOops! Did I say something bad !? when baby is coming, cute, cuddly little baby, I am talking about his/her death. But it is true, right? How much lie decoration we do it is truth. In my opinion, every baby should know this truth at first. how he/she came to the world and there is a fixed time that will come when he/she will leave this world. Why should we do false acting to each other ?!\n\nFor getting some hope, temporary happiness-peace! Yes, I know how depressed we are, how much coward we are. We like easiness and fun. We just can be robots, going with the flow till death. But I don’t know how much it is worth it. We all want a warranty, a guarantee for every precious thing. Buying jewelry we ask if is it real, prove it. Buying real estate, cars, in business….. we can do the calculation, strategies point to point every single thing. No mistake allows, Not to become betrayed, Not being a fool.\n\nSee we need proof, we do inquiry. We become furious when we get betrayed by something like that. The more precious it is, we need more proof and more investigation. But somehow most people miss this point in calculation and make the right order of preciousness from high to low. It’s ok, It’s ok, It’s totally ok 😀. You see you are the one who is putting self worth. No one did anything but you do it to yourself 😐. Putting yourself below the list.\n\nWe all are afraid of the truth. Yes, it is hard. And need hard work, need too much bravery, and struggle. When we are getting too much temporary happiness why will anyone go for that. There are so many options for getting temporary peace of mind, that keep us away from the truth. One is out another. Don’t worry we are here to bring happiness, and peace into your life just don’t see, don’t hear, don’t think ok.\n\nI don’t understand, am I wrong or other people. People feel irritated, and uneasy around me. So I decided not to talk much.🤫 Because if in case my mouth is open I just can say the truth without any punctuation signs. Like, oh I got a chance to talk, bring it on 😎. No argument in there. And I also can’t do false withdrawals, it will end up more dangerous. I will have outbursts without any control. So both sides of people should keep a safe distance as they can manage. Or if my mouth is open totally be on the truth side otherwise bring some valid authentic statement.\n\nLet’s go back to our topic. we people have limitations on every side.\n\nSecond mental. Think of any country there are three presidents, and three of them have conflicts with each other. which situation it will be for that country? Like that, you should make a settlement with every part, and section of yourself. Yes, you are a king/queen of your own world. But just don’t go start a war with another kingdom. First, make your kingdom strong enough. Be an intelligent, kind, wise king/queen.\n\nThird soul. All are your part. so you have to make balance and make time to listen to them, understand them, and make settlement among everything of you.\n\nAs you see in this world, in one country people make jokes of another country people how their look is, what they eat, what they wear, how they talk, every single thing….. some people just understand that their eyes are made for that job, and brain is to process those. Even in between neighbors, and inside the home. All places have conflicts.\n\nAnd if anyone thinks about you wrong you can’t change it, no matter how much you try. It is their decision. Already they made the decision that’s how they are.\n\nIt is really scary resting and sleeping inside of those people. It is all a circle. Come tell us we are your close one, then some console you or show their true self earlier and bully you, they will say I should ask them to help, council with them and how much life saver, helper they would be. But hold on, don’t go to a conclusion, next time you do that as they said last time how much they care for you, Now fasten your seat belt they will say why can’t I do my job by myself, they have so many works, how much pressure they are getting,….. Again that point I want to detach everyone from my life, and then the statement will be, oh so you became a big knowledgeable person and no one can reach you….\n\nyou know what, I am out of here. Somehow this circle should be broken. And there is no way than me. The rescuer of my own self is just me. I should not let myself be insulted no matter who the person is. God gave us same same.\n\nNo, I am not encouraging you to be reckless. I want everyone to understand who he/she is.\n\nWhy should any country’s people mock another country? Yes, there is a unique system, a unique rule. And that’s not made by me/you or he/she. The ruler should think about everyone, make justice, and give equal and unique judgment to all no matter who he/she is.\n\nOur work and thinking make us. It doesn’t mean where are you from, how you look, or which level you are…. it should give an equal judgment.\n\nI want this. And for me, it seems that the world is against me.\n\nI can’t contact my past people or future people. I am in my own era where I am supposed to be. In my generation all my people, understand me and I can understand them more than any other era/generation people can understand us.\n\nBe unity, be strong, don’t fall apart. Yes not all of us are good but it is the responsibility of knowledgeable and strong people they make it as good as possible.\n\nLook at the world and how it became. How every second, every hour we are spending."

    "content": "Whom should I laugh at ?! I can’t believe I smile thinking about my own activities. If it would be I am smiling thinking about a guy, it might be I am in love with that man. But I feel happy being about myself, then maybe I am in love with who created me.\n\nAmazing this is! Still, there is suffering, so many feelings that we don’t want, want to stay away from. But strange is how much we run from it the more we suffer until we accept it. At last, it was meant to happen.\n\nI noticed people get some emotions toward someone but it’s totally different emotions when the same things are done by a person they know. Like if a strange person says, “You look good”. We wonder why that person is asking this, and what is the intention because that person should not say any of those things.\n\nI don’t know how much freedom we have, it is like you are by yourself now. Fight for yourself every moment, you are yours now we don’t care what happens to you. Anyone other than myself can be my enemy, the opposite party. That’s how much freedom we have. We have freedom so why are we suffering, it is still frustrating? Do we love to complain too much? Got it, so now the war portion left for inside of us, which we are too afraid to face. So afraid to fight or have a settlement. We are fleeing from ourselves.\n\nBALANCING. Balancing, that’s what I want to say. We need a balanced diet. On food, relationship, activities, ….. you know physical, mental, and spiritual.\n\nSo many complex emotions, thinking, understanding, and arguments…. come that much as we get older. It is hard to get proper decisiveness in any situation but for a good wiser person.\n\nIn our academics, careers, and race in life, we forget to learn about ourselves. Forget to see around us, listen, and think. Maybe this is happening to a foreign-educated engineer girl. Now when she sees a simple leaf she can just see that leaf with all curiosity, love, and pleasure for the whole day without being tired. Want to see the sky the whole night, just stare at it. Listen to nature. Look at insects, birds, animals, colors, flowers, fruits, plants, …… everything is amazing. Eyes are not just for staring at a book or device. You can use it in many other ways too.\n\nI don’t know if I am lazy or not but I like to see ants going. How they are doing their jobs, works. How they look. How birds fly, work, live. I want to just sit and observe. I don’t care if anyone thinks I am a boring person or an older person or lazy because I am doing nothing. Who can make that compliment, I can say please visit the doctor, you need treatment.\n\nThe problem is we need money to survive. Money can be earned easily if you can become mute, blind, or deaf. Poor aren’t allowed to be human. And the rich can’t be human. We are the ones who make those rules, we are the ones who complain about it, and we are the ones who reject the solutions. If it would be only one person It could be easily handled. But it is us. We are immature but arrogant, prideful, and too tied up.\n\nWhat can we do? We have to play our roles, complete our responsibilities, and give the rights to the right person. Who said you have nothing to give. When you meet an older person you can give respect to them. When a child comes you can be playful and give love. When you have parents look after them, be patient, be nice.\n\nWe have nothing to give. What can I say to that poor soul? who likes to see oneself down, empty. Don’t make yourself a loser. When the creator made you as the treasure box."

If that person was me I would laugh and reply that the bigger stupid saying another stupid, a stupid.🤣\n\nBut I am me. I can’t expect my behavior from others. Deep down I know how much hurt, and trouble comes from being so nice, naïve, and simple-minded. You see, bad guys are developing on the bad side every moment. And good guys developing on the good side. And when they meet each other it becomes a complex matter, literally blast. \n\nIf you don’t have any defense system and have no knowledge of how to protect yourself, then you accept that your all precious thing you are just collecting and saving for the bad guys to come and take it. And then you will regret it, and be sad.\n\nSo, I don’t want anyone to get hurt like I got. So it is a love expression for my loved one who really knows me. A good person should be more energetic, and intelligent. If criminals become more intelligent than police then it is the place of daily crime where we are living. See how a bad person works too hard to do bad. So we should have developed ourselves more stronger and more intelligent. Good should be 10 steps ahead of bad.\n\nKnowledge is power. The good and bad depend on its use. Police know how to do crime more than criminals but they use that knowledge for good. That is how they become good police officers.\n\nBut if I say to a person who is confused and has complex feelings for me, “You are stupid”. That person will show confused feelings. Because already that person made an image of me and gave a my identity inside of him. That’s how he knows me. \n\nAnd for my enemy if I say, “You are stupid”, don’t ask. It will be the same as declaring war, chaos, threat, insult, mock….. 😅\n\nOnly from one sentence, I can find out too many people’s identities. Who is what? It’s amazing, isn’t it?"

    "title": "Silence",
    "content": "Silence words which is better to keep secret and silent. Even though everyone is well aware of it.\n\nDid you ever find yourself left out by another person’s silence?\n\nThe assertive reaction party knows what I meant.\n\nSilence is a more effective killer than any other poison. It kills you quietly, and you don’t even realize what is going on. How did you reach this point! How did you turn out to be this!\n\nYou can understand when people speak the truth and when they lie. A liar never acts normal. They can’t. This is the law of nature. If it is not an open book then there is something worth hiding. If your instincts signal that there is something wrong, don’t dive to search for what is wrong. Just trust your instincts and secure yourself. Don’t take any chances.\n\nIf you don’t like the system you are in, you should bring a new system as you believe it should be, which is better than what it is now. Like if you don’t find any exit make it by yourself. There is no point in sitting there and describing all the facts. And If you can’t do that then you better get used to living in that system.\n\nEverywhere all are gossiping, indicating how bad, and nasty this world and place is. Humanity, politics, economics, disasters….. and we are sitting there and trying to solve it then making it worse afterward. Which is perfect for now, but it becomes worse on the other side. On the other side, some are sitting and judging how all is happening. Some memorize and are being educated, making themselves something but when that system changes whatever they believed in all the education, and efforts go to waste.\n\nWhy are we blaming, judging, and talking about something that will never be solved? That’s just causing us to hate this world, hate each other, and bring just hatred.\n\nThe world of shamelessness. We can keep improving or bringing something good, or happiness in here. Otherwise, just keep silent. Go with the flow, and ignore it keeping your head down. Being blind, mute, deaf, understandable lame, being like stone, like an animal, or even lower than an animal. That’s what we can do.\n\nWho says we are developing, we are in the modern world! Then why still there is sadness, more complaints, and fear in truth, most of the place is full of illusions-lie and all know it. It’s really funny!\n\nSometimes not hearing the truth hurts more than being betrayed. All it is just telling the truth, yes it is what it is. Losing doesn’t matter. The matter is, “not getting an honest, truth statement”.\n\nThere is a saying, “A truthful enemy is better than a liar friend”. And I totally believe it.\n\nWhy should all the important, precious words be heard through the soul? Why can’t those be expressed any other way? Which do I want to know? I always heard from my inside?\n\nSo, that means all the outer words are just disguised. Truthfully, only that person can know who has an understandable mind, or soul. There is a mirror inside of every person. He/she sees all the reflections on that.\n\nDon’t say please. Not any word. Only the confused person talks much. I love soul-to-soul connection. Let them have a chance to be connected. \n\nCan any mother/father express their true feelings in words to their child? All speech stops there. Even knowing 7 languages, people become mute. Can’t find any word from any language.\n\nI know there is body language. A person can lie but body language doesn’t lie. It betrays you. I want to say, that you are the only one and most biggest betrayer of yourself. But I am afraid to read those messages. So the world has this responsibility to solve my problem, I don’t like handling the nasty anymore.\n\nSometimes love, care, respect, protection,….. all good characters totally turn you down just the mistakes of handling those skills. Those good let think, see, hear, understand. Mess, hopeless…. that is how we get bad from bad. Otherwise good also brings good and bad brings bad.\n\nWho doesn’t like children? cutie, little beautiful doll, hope-life renewal. We old people get a chance to see life from the start once more by being around children.\n\nI can’t believe myself for being good I have to be excellent bad. To become a most kindest I have to be perfectly cruel. To love something I have to hate particular things most. To be the softest, kindest person I have to be too harsh, and hard on the opposite… What’s this burden or easiness, I don’t know. The creator says it’s the perfect solution for us, the way of creation. Relief and release from the burden. The balance and combination of it, mastering this skill needs a lot.\n\nWhat a great taste of life !!!"

    "content": "There are so many kinds of people in this world. Also, Lifestyles have so many differences. Like tree branches. You know in a classroom there exist so many students but one teacher. That teacher gives lessons only one way. But that lesson reaches in different ways to every single student. We get different grades, and some fail. Our parent says you have a head, eyes, hands, and legs all like the class topper why did you fail !!! Sorry Mommy/daddy to disappoint you, I tried my best but I am me and Topper is another individual being, he/she never can be me. That’s how we are. This is the beauty of Creation. We try our best and figure out what we are. There are so many options, probabilities, and differences. Enjoy it, learn from it. That’s was never our decision to make, never will be.\n\nI am sure your parents didn’t know they would have a child for sure. We hope, We wish, We dream. We have freedom on that. But reality happens what The Creator wants. Also what kind of child he/she will be in the future. In every second, every moment we wait for surprises to come then we live that moment and prove ourselves who we really are.\n\nOne day we will die. But who knows when, where, and how he/she will die !!! What a surprise. If I knew that my life would be so much boring for sure.\n\nWe don’t have to know everything or discuss everything. There are limitations. A state’s development depends on how many heads/hands/legs/eyes/minds there are. I didn’t mean to be unknowledgeable. I am saying gain useful knowledge. If you can’t do anything with the knowledge or have no authority on that then It’s useless.\n\nI can’t do sunrise or sunset. Bring the moon. Can’t have a curvy moon for all the time. Yes at our dinner table in the family, we do have so many quarrels about which food who wants, how much, how they want to eat, and how food should be. Among countries, if we give chances our own leaders can do non-stop debate till death. But no choice about the sun, We know it so well that we don’t debate about this issue. Who which sun wants, How it should be, which color, when it will rise or set, which one is wrong, which one is right.\n\nThat’s the creation. We have some free choices but from those free choices through so many struggles we learn that actually, we have no choice. All authority is upon the Creator’s hand.\n\nI could have been born in 500 BC or 300 BC or In the future any century. But I was born in this century. I don’t know if was that my choice or not. But the interesting part is whichever century I would/will be born in, my life wouldn’t be perfect, never.\n\nThe earth. It has no fault. Don’t forget this is where we are born, living, and buried. It is under the Creator’s authority. Otherwise, the much we hate it insults being so shameless. For sure It would take revenge. Humans! see who are bad go away from my place, no birth, no living, no dying, nothing on me.\n\nI feel powerless against a mosquito. Yeah if I have money we can buy that place where no insect will enter. But you have insects inside of you. Can you live without that?\n\nIn front of the mirror, I see myself I have bones and organs. All are working. I am not giving any instructions. I don’t tell my digestive system to do work. It does its work itself. My system will alarm me when I am hungry. But I have a choice Which food can I eat. Which food can I afford? That choice my body will not make. It is my choice according to my situation I will make that decision.\n\nSo when I am not giving any instructions to my body, I have no authority over it. I just clean it and keep it well so that I can do my job nicely until I die.\n\nSpirit that is mine. But It has its own wish, hunger. Sometimes we feel empty and don’t know why we feel like that. Some strange feeling, something missing.\n\nWe want something good. Something out of the world. Who will understand us fully, Don’t have to say anything but will know everything, will never leave us what the situation is, 24/7 will be with us, will never be bored with us, will be so patient, never will be tired, Never will be offline, we are humans make mistakes but if I return with a solid apology will forgive us. Will love us doesn’t mean how we look like, how much prosperity we have, will see us as who we are… Those all sound good right. Peace, Happy.\n\nIn spirituality, we have that wish. We search that for whole life. Start from Mother-Father-Siblings-Relatives-Neighbors-Friends-Lover-Life Partner-Childs-grandchild-strangers… But in everywhere there is some emptiness, something less, something missing. That just does not fit what we want. Our whole life we discuss, become frustrated and regret how disappointing life is. We have to compromise it and get used to it. My wish is all just a fairy tale.\n\nBut no. If you want to see something by closing your eyes, you will not see it for sure. Here you are. Your dream came true. You are not searching for any human. Those characteristics don’t fit any human being. This is the existence which your soul knows very well.\n\nYou trust your instinct, don’t you? Ask yourself what it wants. And search for the things that fit those characteristics.\n\nDon’t find something then try to fit your all wishes on that.\n\nFollow the perfect sequence."

Always kept silent and smiled at me.\n\nI never had to do any work at home, and Even if I insisted too hard, became angry. My Big Bro took all the work from me and did it himself.\n\nI remember One day My brother told me he touched my lunch, and I didn’t eat it. My mother explained to me that was Jock many times. Still, I didn’t eat. He used to make too many irritating jocks to see my angry mood.\n\nIt is me. Everything needs to be separated, set accordingly as I want and no one can touch anything.\n\nI remember I got two dresses on Eid with accessories, and my brother took me to the market to buy the dress. He didn’t get anything in Eid but didn’t say a word.\n\nHe replied how much I become angry, scold, insult him, and he will never stop talking to me. stop calling me, message me. Why do I have to be smiley always? It is too hard.\n\nI am angry, temperance but I can see, hear, and understand. People make mistakes thinking, I don’t have any memories. Or maybe they miss me too much. love me too much.\n\nMy brother cried for me, Even I scolded him and told him don’t you have any shame just to make him leave me alone. I am too much broke please I want to handle my side by myself. I know you are more broken than me. And I want sometimes alone.\n\nI know that is totally true. If I have any issue I have to become normal and smile at that moment no matter what. And He works too hard on it seriously. That is really hard to do. I have to be smiley, happy, and in a good position. That really irritates me sometimes, especially at a bad time.\n\nHe hated me when I bellowed myself. Surprise. I have no right to do that. I broke his heart, and I treated myself badly.\n\nHe becomes nervous when I am around because I make him feel I have been changed. And It is totally my fault, I became mature-elder.\n\nNow I want to understand everything myself, love to do everything by myself, I want to think by myself. I am not that angry little doll anymore my big hero. I want to be someone in my sight.\n\nI want to make mistakes, fall again and again, get hurt, and learn-understand everything by myself. I want to explore my life and live my life fully. Want to be responsible for my deeds, and make my own decisions.\n\nNo hurts, mistakes, burdens, or falling can stop me. Let me Explore my life. I am happy You all are with me.\n\nSo he hates me too much because he loves me so much.\n\nThat much is true we both know each other. We both care and love each other. But still, we have to fight to the death. That’s the sibling meaning.\n\nI have so many heroes in my life, He is one of them."

Maybe your honor, or your soul, or your peace, or your time, or maybe your life.\n\nEquivalent exchange for everything. If you understand a section of life, apply it. See how it changes from time to time. Karma is true. Whatever you will do, it will come back to you. Its control is in the creator’s hand. No creation can change it. If you do good and others wish bad to happen to you. It will not happen. Their wish doesn’t matter, it’s your deed and the creator’s wish that matter. But if you do good and others also wish good things happen to you. Of course, good was about to happen to you but now will be better for other people good wishes and clean heart pray.\n\nLife sometimes seems easy and sometimes too hard. It is easy when you are happy and in peace. And it is hard when you are going through a bad time. But keep in mind life is both good and bad. It is the rule of life that good and bad will come one after another. As day and night change bad times will pass and good times will come as always. But don’t just sit down to pass the time because time will solve your problem. It costs too much than you can afford.\n\nOur life is not a simple algorithm. It is too much complex. You can’t say 1 plus 1 equals 2 always happen in real life. Sometimes it is 2, sometimes 0, sometimes millions. It depends upon so many facts. It’s not mathematics it’s Life and it has its unique special rules."

Because some don’t want logic or understanding right or wrong at all. You will be mad if you try that. Because their world is totally different than yours or how it should be. The only place where they are forced to accept the rules and logic is where laws apply and there are punishments for going outside of line. But no law can stop them. Humans are reckless beings. And some people call it freedom.\n\nFreedom doesn’t mean that anyone can do or say anything whatever they want. It means any people can say or do the right things without any fear. That’s the freedom we want.\n\nFor some don’t try to explain. Because some never will understand. On the contrary, they will blame you and hurt you. Leave them. Ignore them. Trustable people achieve trust, don’t try to manipulate people and take advantage.\n\nIf you are proven unworthy. Make yourself worthy rather than make someone else responsible for your unworthiness. Don’t release your own weakness, or depression on a loved one and make it worsen. Maybe a loved one will still be with you but in deep down everyone knows what you are worthy of. It is not what others judge, it’s what you judge.\n\nSome say you should solve problems. What is the point of solving the problem if we create it again and again? Why shouldn’t we do something so we don’t have any? And use those times on something good to move forward in life. Though it’s a good word just think permanent solution but it’s temporary and circular. Nothing is static in this world neither any problem or not any solution.\n\nLife is fantastic. Nothing here is static. Everything is changing, including myself. The me of a minute ago is not the same as the me of right now. Though sometimes it is troublesome, its rules are really interesting.

Trauma, It's too painful to tolerate.\n\nReally devils do exist and they do deserve the hell without any doubt.\n\nSome people say Look how bad people are. I am not doing that much bad so I am good. Even they are Zalim. Some say that happened to a child, it can be tolerable if it would happen to a grown-up. I do rape to grown-up so don't point at me. Other says doing bad to an unknown person is better than doing bad to the known person.\n\nDevils do live everywhere in so many disguises. Some people are proud that they are not too bad, they are tolerable bad, worse is happening in the world. So don’t account them that they are bad. They can do much more bad but they are not doing. Take it as a mercy. \n\nBad incidents always happen in their life, so live a whole life with lies and be happy, don’t complain about anything. Much more bad is happening in the outside world. Husband is killing wife, so beating wife is a minor issue for them. Mentally, Emotionally, and physically torture is minor. See you are living so that you can do something about it, take it as mercy from them. \n\nGo to the world and see that people are not getting food to eat, have no shelter. I am giving you food and shelter, and you are complaining about what toxic behavior, toxicity. Tolerate when you don’t earn. Forget all bad things, but I will not forgive you even the slightest good. You need to be better than angle. I am your GOD because husbands are worthy to get prostrated, If Hz. Muhammad sm said if he would say to give sajda to anyone other than Allah it would be the husband.   \n\nYou need to be better because you are Islamic. But I don’t care what Islam is, what does it say? Know Islam to give me the advantage, I learnt some of the broken Quranic ayah and hadith to take all the advantage to astray you from your religion, morality, humanity. What Islam did you learn?! What does Islam do to you?! What does Islam teach you, to talk back?! You talk too much, what does Islam teach you ?! But I don’t care about Islam. \n\nPeople think Islam should be weak. Islamic people mean weak, have no other way to live, their life is finished, without livelihood, begging, forgiving everything, crying in secret, keep everything in secret even if they see crime. They do forgive the worst because they are too merciful. As Hz. Muhammad sm was so merciful, forgave his enemy, kafir. \n\nPeople say killing is a sin. What is killing, which kind of killing?!  Abortion is legal in this world. People are killing children secretly. \n\nSEX what? Is it shameful something?! Nasty things?! How prophets do sex and worship Allah simultaneously. SEX is a purified thing. Some people will never understand. People's mentality got rotten. \n\nNo, I am not fantasizing about all those. I faced those in my life. I encounter that type of people in my life. I am so happy that Allah created hell. \n\nSome people have too much honor, so they reduce their problems in the name of honor killing. People don’t have any fear. Why should all people need to get rahmat?! Don’t dua for everyone to have some brain, mind, and humanity.\n\nAllah did create Heaven for Human beings. Allah didn’t give heaven to the angels. And angles do everything that Allah orders. Some people do have problems with Allah and angles too. With Prophets, the Quran, and hadith too. Why doesn’t Allah save the good people?! Why doesn’t Allah listen to Islamic people?! Why does Allah give Islamic people hardship ?! Don’t explain, don’t argue with people, they just don’t deserve your effort.\n\nHUMANS HAVE SOME BRAIN. WHERE IS YOUR MIND. "
